# Offline deployment

## manage-offline-container-images.sh

Container image collecting script for offline deployment

This script has two features:
(1) Get container images from an environment which is deployed online.
(2) Deploy local container registry and register the container images to the registry.

Step(1) should be done online site as a preparation, then we bring the gotten images
to the target offline environment. if images are from a private registry,
you need to set `PRIVATE_REGISTRY` environment variable.
Then we will run step(2) for registering the images to local registry.

Step(1) can be operated with:

```shell
manage-offline-container-images.sh   create
```

Step(2) can be operated with:

```shell
manage-offline-container-images.sh   register
```

## generate_list.sh

This script generates the list of downloaded files and the list of container images by `roles/download/defaults/main.yml` file.

Run this script will execute `generate_list.yml` playbook in kubespray root directory and generate four files,
all downloaded files url in files.list, all container images in images.list, jinja2 templates in *.template.

```shell
./generate_list.sh
tree temp
temp
├── files.list
├── files.list.template
├── images.list
└── images.list.template
0 directories, 5 files
```

In some cases you may want to update some component version, you can declare version variables in ansible inventory file or group_vars,
then run `./generate_list.sh -i [inventory_file]` to update file.list and images.list.
